# Crowdfunding_ETL


For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Create the Campaign DataFrame
Create the Contacts DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database


Create the Crowdfunding Database
Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBDLinks to an external site..
Use the information from the ERD to create a table schema for each CSV file.

Create a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db.
Using the database schema, create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
Verify the table creation by running a SELECT statement for each table.
Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
Verify that each table has the correct data by running a SELECT statement for each.
